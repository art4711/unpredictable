# Unpredictable number generator #

This is a Go implementation of the same algorithm as implemented by
OpenBSD `arc4random()`.

## Naming ##

The package is called "unpredictable" to point out the fact that we
provide unpredictable numbers, not "random". My reasoning is that the
word "random" has been so badly misused within computer science that
it today means "perfectly predictable" with the added assumption that
each run of a program will produce the exact same sequence. Therefore
I chose the name "unpredictable" to point out that we are not
"random". The word "unpredictable" is hopefully less ambiguous and any
suggestion to make the returned numbers predictable can be deflected
by saying that the API is supposed to return unpredictable numbers,
it's right there in the name.

## API ##

Currently there are three APIs provided:

 * A math/rand.Source which we can get by calling
   `unpredictable.NewMathRandSource()`. It provides the interface that
   math/rand expects, but the Seed() function causes a panic, since we
   want to provide unpredictable numbers, not random.

 * An `io.Reader` which we can get by calling `unpredictable.NewReader()`

 * `unpredictable.Read()` which is like a normal `io.Reader`. This is
   goroutine safe.

## Correctness ##

The implementation has been tested against OpenBSD arc4random. When
both generators are fed the exact same entropy they generate the same
byte sequence for at least 1680000 bytes (number chosen since the only
interesting special case in the OpenBSD arc4random happens at 1600000
bytes). Any bugs in here are likely to show up there too.

## Performance ##

When plugged into math/rand each call to Int63 takes 27ns/op on my
machine. This compared to the default math.random source which take
8ns/op and compared to buffered `C.arc4random` calls at 35ns/op. See
[my test repository for more details](https://github.com/art4711/randbench).

When used as an `io.Reader` this looks even better. `math/rand` can
pump 430MB/s on my MacBook, unpredictable does 460MB/s.

## Entropy source ##

Our entropy comes from "crypto/rand" which is hopefully of high enough
quality (just slow).

## Additional safety ##

As opposed to the OpenBSD implementation we don't have fork detection
(not sure how to approach that in Go) and locking is up to the
user.
